### Household Electric Power Consumption
Link Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set

#### Context: 
Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

#### Data Set Characteristics:
Multivariate, Time-Series

#### Associated Tasks:
Regression, Clustering

#### Database information:
- This database have 2,075,259 rows and 7 columns.
- date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- time: time in format hh:mm:ss
- global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
- global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
- voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
- global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
- sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
- sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
- sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
